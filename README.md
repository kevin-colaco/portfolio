### Building for Web Deployment

## üîß Deployment on GitHub Pages

This project is configured for easy deployment on GitHub Pages.

1.  After building with `flutter build web`, the `build/web` directory contains the static files.
2.  In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings > Pages**.
3.  Set the **Source** to "Deploy from a branch" and select the `gh-pages` branch (you may need to create it) or the `/docs` folder. A common method is to push the contents of `build/web` to the `gh-pages` branch.
    *   *Pro Tip: You can use the `gh-pages` npm package or GitHub Actions to automate this process after every push to `main`.*
